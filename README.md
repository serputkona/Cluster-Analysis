# Cluster-Analysis
This repository focuses on cluster analysis and includes:

1. Performing Cluster Analysis: Using hierarchical clustering and k-means (or other methods) on a selected dataset with multiple features. Data transformation is applied if needed. At least two clustering methods are used and compared (e.g., centroid-based and nearest neighbor), with Euclidean distance for quantitative data and appropriate methods for nominal data.
2. Selecting Optimal Number of Clusters: Generating visualizations to optimize different metrics for varying numbers of clusters and justifying the chosen number.
3. Visualizing Clustering Results: For two or three selected clustering solutions, visualizing the results, potentially using principal component analysis.
4. Comparing Clustering Solutions: Evaluating the selected clustering solutions using the Rand index.
