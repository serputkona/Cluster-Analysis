# Cluster Analysis

This repository focuses on cluster analysis and includes the following components:

## Performing Cluster Analysis

- **Clustering Methods**: Applies hierarchical clustering and k-means (or other methods) on a selected dataset with multiple features. Includes data transformation if needed.
- **Comparison**: Uses at least two clustering methods (e.g., centroid-based and nearest neighbor) and compares them. Utilizes Euclidean distance for quantitative data and appropriate methods for nominal data.

## Selecting Optimal Number of Clusters

- **Optimization**: Generates visualizations to optimize different metrics for varying numbers of clusters. Justifies the chosen number of clusters based on these metrics.

## Visualizing Clustering Results

- **Visualization**: Visualizes results for two or three selected clustering solutions. Potentially uses principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and better visualization.

## Comparing Clustering Solutions

- **Evaluation**: Compares the selected clustering solutions using the Rand index to assess the similarity between different clustering results.
